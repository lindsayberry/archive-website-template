According to W. Edwards Deming, "In God we trust.  All others must bring data."  I firmly believe in harnessing the power of data to make more informed decisions, whether in a business, baseball, or life.  Through Bayesian modeling, inference, and prediction, we can iteratively update our beliefs as new data arrives and make the best decisions we can based those beliefs.

My name is Kyle Burris and I am a PhD student in the department of Statistical Science at Duke University.  I am an avid sports fan and love to examine common baseball questions from a Bayesian perspective.  

My research involves predictive modeling, missing data, Bayesian inference, and game theory.  As I continue to work on research in this vein, I hope to periodically describe some cool problems that I'm working on and how Bayesian modeling can be used to answer complex, multilevel questions, particularly when data is not plentiful.
