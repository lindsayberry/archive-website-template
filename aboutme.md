I'm a Statistical Scientist at [Berry Consultants](https://www.berryconsultants.com/) working on designing innovative and adaptive clinical trials. Prior to joining Berry, I received my PhD in [Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu/) from [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). 

My graduate research with [Mike West](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mw/) and [84.51&deg;](https://www.8451.com/) was on large scale Bayesian forecasting in the context of product demand forecasting. My research touched upon topics in forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more! 

From 2011 to 2015, I attended the University of Texas at Austin, where I received my BS in Mathematics and was a member of the Dean's Scholars.

Outside of statistics, I enjoy reading, yoga, hiking, adventuring with my dog Maverick, and [biking for good causes](https://bikeandbuild.org/).
