I have broad research interests in Bayesian statistics.  My PhD research included topics such as forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more!

#### Demand Forecasting for High Dimensional Time Series of Counts
As a prior research assistant for 84.51&deg;, I worked on forecasting the daily sales of supermarket products, with a specific focus on low-selling products. This project involves developing sequential, on-line forecasting models for low volume count data.  The following two papers address my research in this area. 

[Bayesian forecasting of many count-valued time series](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350015.2019.1604372?journalCode=ubes20#.XTHPjJNKiXE)  
[Probabilistic forecasting of heterogeneous consumer transaction-sales time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04698)
