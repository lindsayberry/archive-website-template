I have broad research interests in Bayesian statistics.  My current research touches upon topics including forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more!  Below are some of the projects I'm currently involved in.

#### Demand Forecasting for High Dimensional Time Series of Counts
As a research assistant for 84.51&deg;, I am interesting in forecasting demand for products with low volume daily sales counts. This project involves developing sequential, on-line forecasting models for low volume count data.
