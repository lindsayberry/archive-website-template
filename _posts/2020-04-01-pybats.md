title: PyBATS package for Bayesian forecasting
---

Isaac Lavine and Andrew Cron have developed an open-source Python package to implement Bayesian time series models including the DGLM and DLM. This package includes the dynamic count mixture model (DCMM) from Berry and West (2019). I highly recommend [checking it out](https://lavinei.github.io/pybats/). Great work by Isaac and Andrew!
